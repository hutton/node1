 No logins, No passwords
There are no accounts to create or passwords to remember, just enter your email address and away you go.

 Beautifully simple
See everyone's availability and update your own from our beautiful responsive web interface.

 Intelligent email
Send an email to the event's group address to update your availability i.e. "I can do Monday or Wednesday next week".

 Completely free
Convenely is completely free and we don't show ads.

 Minimal setup
It takes just seconds to create your event, enter your email address and a name for what you're arranging and that's it.
