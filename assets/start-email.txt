Hey!  I'm trying to arrange a poker night and I'm using this cool email list from Convenely to figure out the best day.

Either reply to this email with when you're available (I can do next Thursday or Friday, Wednesday next week is best for me, the 8th and 11th are good etc) or click the link below and fill out when you're available and Convenely will do the rest!
