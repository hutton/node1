** Description
Convenely gives you an email list with a difference.  It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scan emails and extract any availability information from the sender, we then build a simple table showing who is available when and include it in every message.

It couldn't be simpler, there's no link to send around or website to visit just reply to the mailing list and we'll do the rest. 

Convenely is an email only product.  It's main selling point is that groups of people can find the most suitable day for an event just from their inbox.

Exisiting group scheduling webapps work by sending a link to users who open a page and fill out when they're available.  Convenely lets you do all this from your inbox, just reply to the mailing list with when you're available ("I can do Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday", "next Thursday is good for me", "any day this week apart from Friday") and we will do the rest.






When a group is arranging an event they generally have a group email chain going disscussing where they're meeting or what they're going to do, why shouldn't their scheduling discisson be in there too?
