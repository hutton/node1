Hi Ian,

I hope you're still finding Meetifyr useful and it's not giving you any problems.  I've been working on a successor to Meetifyr and would really appreciate your thoughts on it.  

Convenely has a been built from the ground up to work well on mobile devices and tablets but the main difference is that every event has it's own email address (i.e. bowling-night@convenely.com) which can be used to contact everyone invited to the event.

Visit http://convenely.com to take a look and let me know what you think.

Many thanks
Simon

P.S. Meetifyr is not going anywhere, it look's after itself and I have no plans to do anything with it.
