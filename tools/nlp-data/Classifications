Easy

25th would be OK						free_single day
25th works for me 						free_single day

Thurs 21st looks OK						free_single day
next week isn't great 					busy_multi span
I’m away this week
I've got no plans for tomorrow 
Thursday is best for me
Wednesday works for me. 
Shall we go for Wednesday
suggest Wednesday 19th?
How about 12th / 13th, 19th / 20th Dec? 
might be OK for 1st
Can't do 31st
can't make tomorrow
can do 31st or 1st Nov.
wont be able to make the 31st
Wednesday Oct 31st is best for me
I'm in for Wednesday 29th
I should be able to make the 29th
can’t make it on the 31st
I can't do 30th
Friday 3rd anyone?
I could do that Friday
the 3rd is a possibility.
I‘m away this week and next

Medium
------
I can do Monday, Wednesday and possibly Thursday
I can do Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday. 
I can do Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday but not Monday
I could do the 1st but not the 31st
I wont be around on the 29th and the 31st is tricky
22nd would possibly be OK, 29th or 30th, definitely, 31st, definitely not
Does 22nd, 29th or 30th August work for anyone

Hard
----
Tuesday of the next week works [shifts context to next week], possibly Wednesday or Thursday at a push.
busy next week [shift context] could do any day the week after.
possibility of Thurs next week [shift context] greater possibility of Friday
I’m free Mon – Thurs this week, next week and the week after. [repeat Mon - Thurs for next and week after]
the 1st, this Thursday could be a good plan.
Thursday’s are generally best for me
I'm now down to the 29th or 30th, or as they are also known, next Wednesday or Thursday
I can't make you dates, but will offer Friday the 31st August.
